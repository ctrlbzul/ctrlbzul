### Hello There 👋
My name is Zulfikri, (u can call me Zul). I live in Indonesia at Medan City. 2017 is my first year "into" programming. I start with HTML & CSS and during the Covid19 pandemic (2020), I start to learn C++ as my first programming language (better late than never, right?😄). I love Programming and Design and would never think twice to share my knowledge with everyone ❤️
